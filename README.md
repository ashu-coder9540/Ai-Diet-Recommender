# Ai-Diet-Recommender
This is a Flask-based web application that provides personalized dietary recommendations based on a user’s BMI, dietary preference, and health goal (weight loss, muscle gain, or maintenance). It uses a machine learning model (Random Forest Classifier) trained on a balanced food dataset to recommend meals that match the user's nutritional needs and calorie limit.

🚀 Features
Calculates BMI and daily calorie requirements
Supports 3 health goals: Weight Loss, Muscle Gain, and Maintenance
Supports multiple dietary preferences: Veg, Non-Veg, and Veg + Egg
Intelligent filtering to strictly match user’s diet and goal
ML-powered food prediction based on:
Calories (kcal)
Protein
Fat
Carbohydrates
Fiber
🧠 Machine Learning
Model: RandomForestClassifier
Accuracy: Trained to maintain ≥ 94% accuracy
Augmented training: Includes synthetic label generation for better prediction
Feature set:
Energy (kcal)
Protein, Fat, Carbohydrates, Fiber
Encoded Goal & Diet Type
📁 Dataset
